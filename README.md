# hairbook-project

This full stack app was built with Bootstrap, AngularJS, Node, ExpressJS, MassiveJS, PostgresSQL, & google maps API.

The motivation from building this app came from my experience as a hairdresser. After creating an awesome haircut or color, I always found myself saving the image on my phone. But often it became troublesome as I saved the images with out a description of how the haircut came to existance. I created this app personally to help hairdresser's record their sales, tips, portfolios, track clientele and more. This site is undergoing more dynamic changes and will be implemented in Angular 4 in the future.
